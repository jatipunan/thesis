   abstract = {Tone Transfer is a novel deep-learning technique for interfacing a sound source with a synthesizer, transforming the timbre of audio excerpts while keeping their musical form content. Due to its good audio quality results and continuous controllability, it has been recently applied in several audio processing tools. Nevertheless, it still presents several shortcomings related to poor sound diversity, and limited transient and dynamic rendering, which we believe hinder its possibilities of articulation and phrasing in a real-time performance context. In this work, we present a discussion on current Tone Transfer architectures for the task of controlling synthetic audio with musical instruments and discuss their challenges in allowing expressive performances. Next, we introduce Envelope Learning, a novel method for designing Tone Transfer architectures that map musical events using a training objective at the synthesis parameter level. Our technique can render note beginnings and endings accurately and for a variety of sounds; these are essential steps for improving musical articulation, phrasing, and sound diversity with Tone Transfer. Finally, we implement a VST plugin for real-time live use and discuss possibilities for improvement.},

   abstract = {Autoregressive neural networks, such as WaveNet, have opened up new avenues for expressive audio synthesis. High-quality speech synthesis utilizes detailed linguistic features for conditioning, but comparable levels of control have yet to be realized for neural synthesis of musical instruments. Here, we demonstrate an autoregressive model capable of synthesizing realistic audio that closely follows fine-scale temporal conditioning for loudness and fundamental frequency. We find the appropriate choice of conditioning features and architectures improves both the quantitative accuracy of audio resynthesis and qualitative responsiveness to creative manipulation of conditioning. While large autoregressive models generate audio much slower than real-time, we achieve these results with a more efficient WaveRNN model, opening the door for exploring real-time interactive audio synthesis with neural networks.},

   abstract = {Neural music instrument cloning is an application of deep neu-ral networks for imitating the timbre of a particular music instrument recording with a trained neural network. One can create such clones using an approach such as DDSP [1], which has been shown to achieve good synthesis quality for several instrument types [2]. However, this approach needs about ten minutes of audio data from the instrument of interest (target recording audio). In this work, we modify the DDSP architecture and apply transfer learning techniques used in speech voice cloning [3] to significantly reduce the amount of target recording audio required. We compare various cloning approaches and architectures across durations of target recording audio, ranging from four to 256 seconds. We demonstrate editing of loudness and pitch as well as timbre transfer from only 16 seconds of target recording audio. Our code is available online 1 as well as many audio examples. 2},

@article{Karras2017,
   abstract = {We describe a new training methodology for generative adversarial networks. The key idea is to grow both the generator and discriminator progressively: starting from a low resolution, we add new layers that model increasingly fine details as training progresses. This both speeds the training up and greatly stabilizes it, allowing us to produce images of unprecedented quality, e.g., CelebA images at 1024^2. We also propose a simple way to increase the variation in generated images, and achieve a record inception score of 8.80 in unsupervised CIFAR10. Additionally, we describe several implementation details that are important for discouraging unhealthy competition between the generator and discriminator. Finally, we suggest a new metric for evaluating GAN results, both in terms of image quality and variation. As an additional contribution, we construct a higher-quality version of the CelebA dataset.},

   abstract = {A longstanding problem in machine learning is to find unsupervised methods that can learn the statistical structure of high dimensional signals. In recent years, GANs have gained much attention as a possible solution to the problem, and in particular have shown the ability to generate remarkably realistic high resolution sampled images. At the same time, many authors have pointed out that GANs may fail to model the full distribution ("mode collapse") and that using the learned models for anything other than generating samples may be very difficult. In this paper, we examine the utility of GANs in learning statistical models of images by comparing them to perhaps the simplest statistical model, the Gaussian Mixture Model. First, we present a simple method to evaluate generative models based on relative proportions of samples that fall into predetermined bins. Unlike previous automatic methods for evaluating models, our method does not rely on an additional neural network nor does it require approximating intractable computations. Second, we compare the performance of GANs to GMMs trained on the same datasets. While GMMs have previously been shown to be successful in modeling small patches of images, we show how to train them on full sized images despite the high dimensionality. Our results show that GMMs can generate realistic samples (although less sharp than those of GANs) but also capture the full distribution, which GANs fail to do. Furthermore, GMMs allow efficient inference and explicit representation of the underlying statistical structure. Finally, we discuss how GMMs can be used to generate sharp images. 1},

Second, we introduce NSynth, a large-scale and high-quality dataset of musical notes that is an order of magnitude larger than comparable public datasets. Using NSynth, we demonstrate improved qualitative and quantitative performance of the WaveNet autoencoder over a well-tuned spectral autoencoder baseline.

However, the state-of-the-art is very difficult to quantify; different studies often use different evaluation methodologies and different metrics when reporting results, making a direct comparison to other systems difficult if not impossible. Furthermore, the perceptual relevance and meaning of the reported metrics in most cases unknown, prohibiting any conclusive insights with respect to practical usability and audio quality. This paper presents a study that investigates state-of-the-art approaches side-by-side with (i) a set of previously proposed objective metrics for audio reconstruction, and with (ii) a listening study. The results indicate that currently used objective metrics are insufficient to describe the perceptual quality of current systems.},

As an alternative, we propose adapting the Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) metric used to evaluate generative image models to the audio domain. FAD is validated using a wide variety of artificial distortions and is compared to the signal based metrics signal to distortion ratio (SDR), cosine distance and magnitude L2 distance. We show that, with a correlation coefficient of 0.52, FAD correlates more closely with human perception than either SDR, cosine distance or magnitude L2 distance, with correlation coefficients of 0.39, -0.15 and -0.01 respectively.},

@article{Masuda2021,
   abstract = {While synthesizers have become commonplace in music production, many users find it difficult to control the parameters of a synthesizer to create the intended sound. In order to assist the user, the sound matching task aims to estimate synthesis parameters that produce a sound closest to the query sound. Recently, neural networks have been employed for this task. These neural networks are trained on paired data of synthesis parameters and the corresponding output sound, optimizing a loss of synthesis parameters. However, synthesis parameters are only indirectly correlated with the audio output. Another problem is that query made by the user usually consists of real-world sounds, different from the synthesizer output used during training. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to the problem of synthesizer sound matching by implementing a basic subtractive synthesizer using differentiable DSP modules. This synthesizer has interpretable controls and is similar to those used in music production. We can then train an esti-mator network by directly optimizing the spectral similarity of the synthesized output. Furthermore, we can train the network on real-world sounds whose ground-truth synthesis parameters are unavailable. We pre-train the network with parameter loss and fine-tune the model with spectral loss using real-world sounds. We show that the proposed method finds better matches compared to baseline models.},

   abstract = {Implicit generative models, which do not return likelihood values, such as generative adversarial networks and diffusion models, have become prevalent in recent years. While it is true that these models have shown remarkable results, evaluating their performance is challenging. This issue is of vital importance to push research forward and identify meaningful gains from random noise. Currently, heuristic metrics such as the Inception score (IS) and Frechet Inception Distance (FID) are the most common evaluation metrics, but what they measure is not entirely clear. Additionally, there are questions regarding how meaningful their score actually is. In this work, we study the evaluation metrics of generative models by generating a high-quality synthetic dataset on which we can estimate classical metrics for comparison. Our study shows that while FID and IS do correlate to several f-divergences, their ranking of close models can vary considerably making them problematic when used for fain-grained comparison. We further used this experimental setting to study which evaluation metric best correlates with our probabilistic metrics. Lastly, we look into the base features used for metrics such as FID.},

   abstract = {Most generative models of audio directly generate samples in one of two domains: time or frequency. While sufficient to express any signal, these representations are inefficient, as they do not utilize existing knowledge of how sound is generated and perceived. A third approach (vocoders/synthesizers) successfully incorporates strong domain knowledge of signal processing and perception, but has been less actively researched due to limited expressivity and difficulty integrating with modern auto-differentiation-based machine learning methods. In this paper, we introduce the Differentiable Digital Signal Processing (DDSP) library, which enables direct integration of classic signal processing elements with deep learning methods. Focusing on audio synthesis, we achieve high-fidelity generation without the need for large autoregressive models or adversarial losses, demonstrating that DDSP enables utilizing strong inductive biases without losing the expressive power of neural networks. Further, we show that combining interpretable modules permits manipulation of each separate model component, with applications such as independent control of pitch and loudness, realistic extrapolation to pitches not seen during training, blind dereverberation of room acoustics, transfer of extracted room acoustics to new environments, and transformation of timbre between dis-parate sources. In short, DDSP enables an interpretable and modular approach to generative modeling, without sacrificing the benefits of deep learning. The library is publicly available 1 and we welcome further contributions from the community and domain experts.},

Autoregressive models, such as WaveNet, model local structure at the expense of global latent structure and slow iterative sampling, while Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), have global latent conditioning and efficient parallel sampling, but struggle to generate locally-coherent audio waveforms. Herein, we demonstrate that GANs can in fact generate high-fidelity and locally-coherent audio by modeling log magnitudes and instantaneous frequencies with sufficient frequency resolution in the spectral domain. Through extensive empirical investigations on the NSynth dataset, we demonstrate that GANs are able to outperform strong WaveNet baselines on automated and human evaluation metrics, and efficiently generate audio several orders of magnitude faster than their autoregressive counterparts.},
